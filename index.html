       <h3>REGULATION(HOMESTASIS)</h3> 
        <b>Regulation</b>
        refers to the ability of living organisms to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. This regulatory process is crucial for the survival of cells, tissues, and entire organisms, as it ensures that physiological conditions remain within optimal ranges for metabolic functions.
        <br><br>
        <b>MECHANISM OF FEEDBACK LOOPS</b><br>
         
        <b>1. Negative Feedback Loops</b>
Negative feedback loops are processes in which the output of a system inhibits or dampens its own production, leading to a stabilization of the system. In other words, when a certain condition or variable deviates from a desired set point, the negative feedback mechanism acts to counteract that deviation, bringing the system back toward equilibrium.They operate like a thermostat, sensing changes and taking corrective action to restore balance.<br><br>

Here's how it works:
        <br>
        <b>1. Sensor (Receptor):</b> Detects a change in a regulated variable (e.g., body temperature, blood sugar, blood pressure).<br>
        <br>     <b>2. Control Center (Integrator): </b>Receives the signal and compares it to a set point (the desired range for the variable). This is often the brain or endocrine glands.<br><br>
        <b>3. Effector: </b>Executes the response to oppose the change and bring the variable back to the set point. This could be muscles, organs, or glands producing hormones.
        <br><br>
        <b>Examples:</b><br>

        <b>Thermoregulation: </b>When your body temperature rises, sensors in your skin and hypothalamus detect the change. The hypothalamus, acting as the control center, signals sweat glands to release sweat, cooling the body down. As you cool, the stimulus (high temperature) is reduced, and the system returns to homeostasis.<br>
        <b>Blood Sugar Regulation: </b>After a meal, blood sugar levels rise. Pancreatic cells detect this increase and release insulin. Insulin helps cells absorb glucose, lowering blood sugar back to normal.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Positive Feedback Loops: </b><br>

 A positive feedback loop is a process in which an initial change or stimulus leads to further changes in the same direction, amplifying the original effect. In other words, the output of a system enhances or increases the initial input, creating a cycle that can lead to exponential growth or rapid change.

        
        
             <br><br>
        <b>Here's how it works:</b>
        <br>
        <b>1. Sensor:</b> Detects a change and sends information to the control center.<br><br>
        <b>2. Control Center:</b> Processes the information and amplifies the change.<br><br>
        <b>3. Effector:</b> Produces a response that further intensifies the initial change, driving the variable further away from the set point.<br><br>

        <b>Examples</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Childbirth:</b> The baby's head pressing against the cervix triggers the release of oxytocin, which strengthens uterine contractions, pushing the baby further down. This cycle continues, amplifying contractions until delivery occurs.<br>
        <b> Blood Clotting: </b>Damaged blood vessels release clotting factors, which activate more factors, forming a clot to stop bleeding. This is a positive feedback loop that ultimately prevents further blood loss.<br><br>
        <b>MECHANISM OF OSMOREGULATION</b><br>
        <br>  <b>Osmoregulation</b> is the process by which living organisms maintain the proper balance of water and solutes in their internal environment, specifically their bodily fluids. This is crucial for cell function and overall survival. The mechanism involves a delicate interplay of several factors, primarily the control of water movement across cell membranes. When the concentration of solutes in the body fluids changes, water moves in or out of cells to restore balance. This movement is driven by osmosis, the natural tendency of water to move from areas of high water concentration (low solute concentration) to areas of low water concentration (high solute concentration). Animals have evolved various specialized organs and mechanisms to regulate water and solute levels. For instance, kidneys filter waste products and control water reabsorption, while the skin and gills in some organisms play a role in water and salt exchange. By meticulously regulating water and solute levels, osmoregulation ensures that cells function properly and that the organism maintains a stable internal environment, even when faced with fluctuating external conditions.
        
        <br><br>The process is controlled by hormones. The
secretion of these hormones is depending on
the osmotic pressure of the blood.
Osmotic pressure depends on the amount of
water and salt present in it.
A rise in the osmotic pressure of blood is
brought about by an increase in salt. (NaCD
concentration also brought about by
reduction in its water content.<br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>When a rise in the osmotic pressure of the
blood</b> is due to a decrease in the amount of
water, blood reaching the brain causes the
brain to register the water shortage. Thus
stimulate the pituitary gland to produce
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE (ADH)
When the hormones reaches the kidney.
ADH makes the distal convoluted tubule and
the collecting duct more permeable to water
so more water is reabsorbed back into the
blood stream.
Water reabsorption will continue until the
Osmotic pressure of the blood is brought
back to normal. When this happens,
secretion of the hormone falls and less water
is reabsorption.
        <br><br>
        <b>When there is a fall in the osmotic pressure
of blood </b>as a result of low concentration of
sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration,
another hormone called ALDOSTERONE İs
secreted from adrenal glands.
This hormone stimulates the tubules to
reabsorb salt (NaCl) back into the blood.
This sodium chloride is returned into the
blood circulation through the RENAL VEIN.
Re absorption will continue until the osmotic
pressure of the blood is brought to its normal
level, then the secretion of the hormone
stops so no more reabsorption of sodium
chloride.
        <br><br><br>
        <b> MECHANISM OF BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION IN MAMMALS</b><br>
One of the most important metabolites in the
blood is glucose, so its level must be
controlled.
Glucose is the end product of carbohydrates
digestion. Glucose is the main respiratory raw
material and must be supplied continuously
to cells.
The brain cells are especially dependent on
glucose and unable to use other metabolites
as an energy source. Lack of glucose
resulting in fainting
Human blood glucOse concentration is
between 80 - 110gm per 1ooc³ of blood, in
order to provide an adequate source of
energy and to maintain the required osmotic
pressure of the blood. Deviation from this
amount will result in an imbalance of energy
supply and osmotic pressure of the blood.
If the concentration of glucose in the blood
rises abOve normal, the osmotic pressure of
blood will also arise resulting in cells losing
more water to the blood than they gain from
it<br>
Deficiency of glucose lowers the osmotic
pressure of blood resulting in the net
movement of water from blood into the
tissue. Also the body will not be getting
enough energy which may result in
convulsions and eventually coma. Thus there
is a need to maintain glucose at required
level.
The level of glucose in the blood is
maintained by two pancreatic hormones,
insulin and glucagon. These hormones are
secreted by specialized group of pancreatic
cells called Islets of langerhans.
The increase in blood sugar concentration
stimulates the secretion of insulin, which is
carried to the liver and muscles, where it
promotes the conversion of the excess
glucose into glycogen and stored in the liver.
Also glucose is converted into fats by the
liver, and stored under the skin, around the
heart, along blood vessels and intestines and
around the kidney.
Hence if the concentration glucose in blood
falls and the secretion of insulin is also
lowered.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>
          
 If the level of glucose in the blood fall
below the normal</b> glucagon is secreted
which stimulate the conversion of glycogen
to glucose which released into blood. Thus
the blood glucose concentration is raised to
bring it back up to normal.
